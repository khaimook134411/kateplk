                            <p>The VSNC pilot valve is a low-cost NAMUR valve that can be used in a wide range of markets. There are two basic versions of the valve kit: the F8 and the FN option. In the F8 version, the valve is suitable for standard applications and has a magnet system with plastic cover and brass armature guide tube. In contrast, the optimized FN option has a cover made of aluminum and a guide tube made of stainless steel in addition to the wide selection of coils for potentially hazardous environments. For this more sturdy variant, the disk seat variant is available in addition to the standard piston valve.</p>

                            <p>Festo linear actuators are double-acting pneumatic piston actuators. The sturdy corrosion-resistant design of the actuators is ideal for use in harsh and hazardous environments in process automation. Actuators with different diameters, stroke lengths and standardized mounting interfaces are available for the respective installation situations. The linear actuators are suitable for open/close and control applications. Special product versions with integrated linear potentiometer or completely integrated positioner are available for control applications. Applications for linear actuators can be found in numerous industrial segments of process automation, such as linear movements for process valves (knife gate valves, shut-off valves, metering valves, pinch valves) or pivoting movements for damper control (ventilation flaps, turbine blade adjustment, ...</p>
